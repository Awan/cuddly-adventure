      <description>Git cherry-picking Aah picking cherries! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I&amp;rsquo;m using git since I started using linux. Cherry-pick is one of those commands I do alot with git. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m preparing a new cherry and will pick it later. üòâ
What&amp;rsquo;s cherry-pick? According to man(1) git-cherry-pick:
Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one introduces, recording a new commit for each. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s tmate? On *nix systems, sometimes we need support. And geeks don&amp;rsquo;t like GUI apps just to have your system in front of them, at least I don&amp;rsquo;t like that üòâ
tmate is terminal sharing software you can use it to connect with your friends and you both work from there. It&amp;rsquo;s available in many distributions repos and in case you aren&amp;rsquo;t lucky enough, you can compile it from source or there are pre-compiled binaries there in their Github page.</description>

      <description>Git is another awesome tool developed and maintained by Linus Torvalds who wrote linux kernel. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how can we use it for our site maintenance. I have a vps on which my site is hosted along with a mail server, git server and a web server too. But I&amp;rsquo;m sure this guide can be used with shared hosting accounts with some modifications.
Install git. Once installed, as root user, create git user and add it to www-data group.</description>
