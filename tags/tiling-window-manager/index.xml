      <description>BSPWM BSPWM is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree. It has support for EWMH and multihead.
Installation bspwm is available in almost all major distributions. If you can&amp;rsquo;t find it in your OS, clone the repository and build it.
Configuration bspwm uses sxhkd for keyboard shortcuts. It has no other way to handle with keyboard input and instead provides bspc program as its interface.</description>
